# CNN Implementation and Investigation on Beans Dataset
## Overview
This project focuses on implementing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models using Keras and Python programming language, with a special emphasis on LeNet and Inception-v3 architectures. The dataset used in this project is the Beans dataset, which is available on the TensorFlow website.

In the first part of the project, the LeNet architecture is implemented and trained on the Beans dataset using a sequential model. The project investigates the effects of L1, L2, and Dropout regularization on each convolution layer of the LeNet network. Additionally, the project explores the impact of the size and count of kernels on the LeNet network's performance.

In the second part of the project, transfer learning is implemented using the trained Inception-v3 network to classify the Beans dataset. The project investigates the performance of transfer learning on the Beans dataset and compares it with the results obtained from training the LeNet network from scratch.

Overall, this project provides an in-depth exploration of the effects of different regularization techniques and hyperparameters on the performance of CNN models, specifically LeNet, as well as the advantages of transfer learning using Inception-v3 architecture for image classification tasks.


This project was completed as part of the "Neural Networks" (changed to "Neural Computing and Deep Learning") course at Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT) in Tehran, Iran, taught by Professor Reza Safabakhsh(<safa@aut.ac.ir>). I took this course during my Master of Science degree in Computer Engineering at AUT in Spring 2022.
